Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

Before you install PyPLIF there are few dependencies you need to install:

* Python >= 2.6
* Open Babel (library) >= 2.2
* Python-OpenBabel >= 1.6
* Python-BitArray
* Python-Numpy >= 1.3

Here's the instruction to install those dependencies on Ubuntu, there's
also the instruction for Fedora below.

In Ubuntu you can simply enter these commands to install those
dependencies (python already installed in Ubuntu & Fedora):

sudo apt-get install openbabel
sudo apt-get install python-openbabel
sudo apt-get install python-bitarray
sudo apt-get install python-numpy

Now, unfortunately for Ubuntu < 11.04 don't have python-bitarray package,
so you have to install it manually by downloading bitarray
from <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray> then install python-dev:

sudo apt-get install python-dev

then unpack the bitarray module and run the setup.py from the extracted
folder like so:

sudo python setup.py install

Now in Fedora you can enter these commands:

sudo yum install openbabel
sudo yum install python-openbabel
sudo yum install python-bitarray
sudo yum install numpy

These steps has proven to be working on Fedora 16. If some step ain't working
then Google is your friend :)


Installation
------------

After all of the dependencies installed, you can install PyPLIF by opening
the terminal and enter the PyPLIF directory and run setup.sh like so:

./setup.sh

If PyPLIF installed successfully then a message like 'PyPLIF successfully
installed' should appear. When PyPLIF is already installed and you're running
setup.sh a message like 'PyPLIF is already installed' will appear.

If you would like to install newer version of PyPLIF and overwrite the old
one then all you need to do is by adding 'force' option to setup.sh like so:

./setup.sh force


Uninstallation
--------------

You can uninstall PyPLIF simply by entering this command:

./setup.sh uninstall
